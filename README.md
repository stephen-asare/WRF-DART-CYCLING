# Assimilating Radar Observation using WRF-DART Cycling
This repository details a sample workflow to perform an Observation System Simulation Experiment on the assimilation of water vapor profiles from the 14th of July 12UTC to the 15 July 12UTC produced by Junkyung et. al 2022. The initial steps describes how to compile the modules and set up enviromental variables and the subsequent instructions details an ensemble cycle assimilation produced in Junkyung et. al 2022. It provides a step by step and a thorough description on the methods, implementations and techniques used. The project is organized into several files for each implementation where for each each implementation theres a driver script  that runs sublevel scripts to complete specific tasks.

# Prerequisites
The project is makes use of the folloWing libraries and modules and the instructioin to compile them are below.
### Environmental Modules
- module load intel/21
- module load openmpi/4.1.0
- ml python/3 
### The Advanced Research WRF (ARW)
- Compiling the required libraries, modules and software used
-
